This is my last project at General Assembly and the project I decided to do was an online dictionary. The way my app works is it takes in the words that you search and sends that to an API to get back the information about a word. If it is a word that hasnt been searched before it will be created in a database.

# Getting started 
[Live Website](https://project-4-patrick-webster1.herokuapp.com/)<br>

Its super simple to use as a single page application, all you have to do is search a word and it will give you back all the information you need and then you can check if a word rhymes or not

# Wins 
The major win for this project was being able to pull information from an api and read it as well as storing it in a database

# Hurdles
The major hurdle for this project was the CSS for me. CSS is my weakest skill and im still developing being able to make things look good but I think that I was able to make the website look decent and fit the theme of an online dictionary
